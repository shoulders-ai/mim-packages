# Mim Apps

Apps for [Mim](https://github.com/shoulders-ai/mim) — the operating system for AI-native research organisations.

Browse and install from **Settings > Apps** inside Mim.

## Apps

| App | Description |

Each app has its own README under `packages/<id>/` with full documentation.

## Development

Clone this repo and open it as your Mim workspace. Mim loads every `packages/<id>/` directory live — edits appear on reload.

```
packages/<id>/
  package.json        # mim manifest (id, views, backend, permissions, engines)
  backend/            # backend entry (index.mjs) and modules
  ui/                 # views referenced by the manifest
```

### Publishing

Bump `version` in `packages/<id>/package.json` and push to `main`. CI regenerates `index.json` from every package manifest and the current commit. Users see updates in Settings > Apps on next refresh.

Packages hosted in other repos can be added to `external.json`. The registry build merges them into `index.json` alongside local packages.

### Tests

```bash
npm install && npx vitest run
```

Tests live next to source files (`packages/**/*.test.{mjs,ts}`). For runtime compatibility testing against the Mim core, see the [core repo](https://github.com/shoulders-ai/mim).
